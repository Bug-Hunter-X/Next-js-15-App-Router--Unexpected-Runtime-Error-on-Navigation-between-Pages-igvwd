# Next.js 15 App Router Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when navigating between pages in a Next.js 15 application using both the `<Link>` component and `useRouter.push()`.  The issue manifests as an unhandled runtime error related to client-side hydration mismatches or unexpected behavior in the App Router, particularly when navigating from a page using a button and useRouter.push() after navigating initially using the Link component.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs under the following conditions:

1. Navigate from the home page to the `/about` page using the `<Link>` component.
2. On the `/about` page, navigate back to the home page using `useRouter.push('/')`.

This sequence often results in an error,  indicating a potential mismatch between the server-side rendering and the client-side hydration of the application. This is a common error seen when the routes don't update smoothly due to inconsistencies in the App Router state.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate from the home page to the about page using the link provided.
5. Navigate back to the home page using the button on the `/about` page.

## Solution

The bug is resolved by adding appropriate loading states or more robust error handling to the application to handle possible race conditions in the App Router.  The updated code ensures the necessary state updates are complete before attempting client-side navigation. The solution may also include more carefully structuring your application's data fetching and navigation to align better with the App Router's behavior.
